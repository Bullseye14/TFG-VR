# Math Ball
Virtual Reality Game to Enhance STEM Learning in Mathematics, by Pol Casaú Civit

## Introduction
This is a Final Degree Project done in the CITM (Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimèdia), in the TTC (Tech Talent Center), Barcelona. 

This project consists on the design and implementation of a Virtual Reality game to help teachers in secondary school give their classes in a funnier and more interesting way, for students to enjoy learning.

## How to play
First of all, go to the [releases](https://github.com/Bullseye14/TFG-VR/releases) page and download the latest release. 

Then, connect your Oculus Quest 2 device to your computer via the Oculus Link and unzip the downloaded file.

Last thing you have to do, open the .exe file, and enjoy!

## Instructions

In this section, the mechanics of each minigame are explained.

- Main Menu: In the main menu, the player has a ray that can be controlled with either the left or the right hand. It can be changed by pressing the grip button. By hovering a minigame with the ray, this will pop in the screen, and, if pressed with the trigger button, that selected minigame will load.
- Minigame 1: In this minigame, the player has to grab the balls that are surrounding him, and throw them to the empty spaces in the walls. If all the operations in the room are correct, another level will automatically come.
- Minigame 2: (WIP) In this minigame, the player has to sort all the pieces in the correct order, by pressing the grip button to trigger the magnet and collect the  pieces, and then releasing the same button to throw the piece in the desired space.
- Minigame 3: (WIP) In this minigame, the player is inside a wagon, that will stop in front of a lever. The player will see a question with three possible answers. By pulling the lever to the desired side, he will be able to choose the answer. The lever is pulled either by grabbing it and moving it wherever wanted or by using the right controller's joystick, moving to left, right or up.
